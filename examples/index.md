# Examples

These are example of `skill-bot` in action.

- [Simple](./simple)
- [MetaGame](./metagame/)
- [Raid Guild Season 0](./raidguild-s0/)
- [Raid Guild Season 1](./raidguild-s1/)
- [Raid Guild Season 2](./raidguild-s2/)
- [Raid Guild Season 3](./raidguild-s3/)
- [Raid Guild Season 4](./raidguild-s4/)


*N.B.* data is **not updated in real-time**, it is just a snapshot.
Generating these graphs is a manual process.

A lille web app that fetches data from the live bot database is pretty simple, if you're up for it, please contribute it to the project!
