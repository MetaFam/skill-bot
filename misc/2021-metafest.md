# The Invisible Web

We are connecte in many more ways than we can imagine

Any two people are linked by interests, experiences, opinions, ...

Discovering this hidden link is hard.

# Online Communities

Even if we are "toghether" all day online, discoverying the hidden links is not trivial.

It does happen serendipitously.

Can we facilitate it?
