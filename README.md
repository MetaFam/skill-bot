# Skill Discovery

This little project is a "hack" developed as part of [MetaFest](https://metafest.metagame.wtf) 2021.

### Objective

Create a graphical representation of people skills and interests.

### Why?

To facilitate social bonding and skills exchange:

 * Find someone that has skill S, which you are looking for
 * Find what skills/interests you have in common with person P
 * Get a general feel of the interests within a community
 * ...

## Project structure

#### ⚠️ HACK ALERT ⚠️
The source of this project is *hack-level* quality.
It was stringed together in less than a week.
Please calibrate your expectations accordingly. For example:

 * ❌ Most of the code is not covered by tests
 * ❌ Code is a hodgepodge of classes, static functions, globals, etc (thanks, Python!)
 * ❌ Some calls are not thread-safe
 * ❌ The data model is as simple as it gets
 * ❌ The rendering is pretty rudimentary
 * etc.

That said, it's in pretty good shape for a hack. Future improvements (if anyone is willing) should be possible incrementally.
